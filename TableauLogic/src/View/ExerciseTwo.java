You either create your formula in the “Input” field or ask for an input from a program. Then you will be prompted to insert the values for each literal, as in a single row of a truth table, and the answer for the calculation. Finally, you can check your answers by clicking the « Check » button and a popup shows up to tell you whether your answer was correct or wrong.";
